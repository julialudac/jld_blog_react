    This website has been created to talk about my experience as a Software Developer, my struggles, my successes and my discoveries.

I care about self-improvement in general and enjoy drawing the link between improving as a Developer and growing personally: I am convinced both journeys are entwined. :)

I am more than happy if my experience adds value to the life of others.

Aside from being a blog, the website also serves as an introduction about myself; feel free to have a look at the <a>corresponding section</a>.
