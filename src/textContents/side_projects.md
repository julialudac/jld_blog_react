## Julia Lu Dac's website
This is simply the present website made with React.


# Past projects

This was the time I was a Jack-Of-All-Trades Software Developer before deciding to specialize in React (+Python).

## ["Tierlists keeper"](https://github.com/julialudac/tierliststocker) (2021)

A system to store tierlists and edit them and their content.
I would say the most interesting and "beautiful" part of this project is the *frontend* folder while I did the rest before knowing well Vue.js and module json-server. Anyway, I let the rest for the purpose of my education.


## ["Forms Input Recording"](https://github.com/julialudac/forms_input_recording) (2020)

I couldn't find a good name for the program, so I gave it this temporary "name".

When I register to a productivity course, I was given a 10-step assessment sheet to fill everyday. I am often tempted to compare the responses I gave for each of the questions, and see whether there may be recurrent elements into my answers.

This is the reason why I began to work on the tool. Given multiple files that are filled forms from the same template, the goal of the tool is to display, for each question, the answers from all the files.

In fact, the program will serve in all situations where there is a form to be filled 
* recurrently. Ex: the 3 questions of Daily Scrum: What did you do yesterday? What do you do today? Is there any inpediment to carry on your task?
* or by different persons. Ex: A questionnaire filled by students to evaluate the teaching of a course. 
* or the form is used as a same framework to follow for different objects. Ex: X-steps to learn something new (pick what you want to learn) 


## Search-Cloud (2019)

(The owner of the project made the decision to keep it private.)

During a 24h Hackathon organized by Facebook Paris, 3 persons and I worked on a project with which we finished 2nd. The developed product is the Minimum Viable Product of a web application whose purpose is to Google a given expression selected from a text, and display to the right of the browser the top results. Therefore, it performs the search on the internet for us, so we don't
have to do all of that manual process of copying the expression, pasting it into the searchbar and searching.

*Big thanks to Marcus for initiating this awesome idea!*

Note: I am convinced that a browser plugin version of it will be terrific!
