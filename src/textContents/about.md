Iâ€™m Julia, a 2019 graduate from the [National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA) in Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en?L=2). Although my studies put an emphasis on Big Data Analytics, I am currently working as a Software Developer.

I want to continually hone my skills and learn new ones while seeing the meaning of what I do. I would also love the opportunity to make a growing company a success!

I don't desire to be the person that is great in every technology that exists, nor the one that knows by heart how to invert a binary tree and solves all puzzles in ten minutes. 

Indeed, I believe technologies are a means, not an end. My first goal is to master the tools that enable me to accomplish what needs to be done. Even if it means later adopting new techs to replace the actual ones.

I believe as a Software Developer, I can contribute to meaningful projects (not just meeting customers' needs): 

* Like many of my friends, I have a profound interest in protecting the environment, either by reducing carbon emissions, eating a plant based diet, reducing waste,...

* Software is made to remove painful processes that strip out value from human's activity.

* Anyone should have access to good quality educational content.

* I believe in any other project helping our environment and brothers and sisters.
